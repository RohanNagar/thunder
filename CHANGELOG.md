# v3.0.1
## ‚öõ Fixed
* Updated the client Javadoc return descriptions.

# v3.0.0
## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Added
* OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications are now available at `/openapi.yaml` and `/openapi.json`
* Swagger UI is available at `/swagger`
* New configuration option: Allow common password mistakes
* Ability to use different database providers
* Added MongoDB database provider
* Added Healthcheck for email providers
* Added more metrics for better observability
* New password hashing algorithm: `sha256`
* DynamoDB table will be created on application startup if it does not exist
* A Helm chart is available for deploying Thunder to a Kubernetes cluster

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Changed
* Required `type` option on the `database` configuration.
* The `md5` password hashing algorithm is no longer available. You should use `sha256` instead.
* Property validation configuration has changed, and allows for more flexible validation. See the docs for more details:

```yaml
properties:
  allowSubset: [true|false]
  allowSuperset: [true|false]
  allowed:
    - name:
      type:
    - name:
      type:
```

* Email verification is now disabled by default. There is a new `type` option in the configuration to specify your email provider:

```yaml
email:
  type: [none|ses]
```

* Additional `User` properties are no longer contained in a JSON object. They should be included directly in the `User` object:

```json
{
  "email" : {
    "address" : "test@test.com",
    "verified" : true,
    "verificationToken" : "hashToken"
  },
  "password" : "12345",
  "customBoolean" : true,
  "customDouble" : 1.2,
  "customInt" : 1,
  "customList" : ["hello", "world"],
  "customMap" : {
    "key" : "value"
  },
  "customString" : "value"
}
```

## ‚öõ Fixed
* A potential bug that would cause all of a user's data to be lost when updating a user's email address has been addressed.

## ‚òï Client
* The endpoint used to build `ThunderClient` is no longer required to end in `/`.
* All methods in `ThunderClient` now return a `CompletableFuture<User>` instead of a retrofit `Call<User>`.

## ‚û°Ô∏è DevOps
* Migrated the CI build from `Travis CI` to `GitHub Actions CI`.
* Migrated Dependabot updates from `dependabot.com` to Github-Native.
* Added GitHub Action to automatically check for updates to the Bootstrap CSS version.
* Added Github Action to automatically approve pull requests from Dependabot.

## Notable Dependency Upgrades
* AWS Java SDK upgraded from `1.11.x` to `2.x`
* `async` in `/scripts` upgraded from `2.6.2` to `3.x`

# v2.1.0
## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Added
* New endpoint to reset a user's verification status (`POST /verify/reset`).
* Server-side hashing is now available. In the new `passwordHash` configuration, set `serverSideHash` to `true` in order to enable it. Server-side hashing will use the algorithm defined in the `algorithm` option. By default, the algorithm is `simple`, which does not actually perform a hash. You can also disable the header check for passwords. By default, most endpoints will require the `password` header to be set to the user's password. To disable this, set `headerCheck` to `false`.

  ```yaml
  passwordHash:
    algorithm: [simple|md5|bcrypt]
    serverSideHash: true
    headerCheck: true
  ```

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Changed
* When updating a user (`PUT /users`), email verification information can no longer be overwritten. Existing verification status will remain the same, or if the email has been updated, the verification status will be reset.
* _**(docs)**_ Moved user documentation from the Github Wiki to [ReadTheDocs](https://thunder-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
* _**(docs)**_ Updated all Javadoc to match new Thunder Javadoc guidelines.

## ‚öõ Fixed
* _**(docs)**_ Javadoc for generated Dagger source files is no longer generated.

## ‚òï Client
* Support for the new `/verify/reset` endpoint.

## ‚û°Ô∏è DevOps
* Run all CI tasks on Travis, and run multiple integration tests in CI.
* Update GitHub Issue templates to set default labels and assignees.

# v2.0.0
## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Added

* Property Validation

  Additional properties defined in the `User` JSON can be validated on `POST` and `PUT`. Simply define the `properties` in the configuration, and they will be automatically validated. To disable validation, do not include `properties` in the configuration.

    Example:
    ```yaml
    properties:
      - name: myFirstProperty
        type: string
      - name: mySecondProperty
        type: list
    ```

  Supported property types are: `string`, `integer`, `double`, `boolean`, `list`, and `map`.

* Optionally Disable Email Verification

  You can now disable email verification if you don't want the endpoints to be active. Simply set the `enabled` option to `false`:
  ```yaml
  email:
    enabled: false
  ```

* More Email Configuration Options

  Use your own HTML pages or email message bodies, or use a custom subject line! Default ones are provided, but you can specify your own:
    ```yaml
    email:
      messageOptions:
        subject: Welcome to My App
        bodyHtmlFilePath: /path/to/verification.html
        bodyTextFilePath: /path/to/verification.txt
        urlPlaceholderString: PLACEHOLDER
        successHtmlFilePath: /path/to/success.html
    ```

  On each `POST` `/verify` request, a verification URL will be generated for the specific user and a String replacement will replace the `urlPlaceholderString` with the correct URL before sending the message. The default placeholder string is `CODEGEN-URL`.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Changed

* ‚ö†Ô∏è `PilotUser` has been renamed to `User`
* ‚ö†Ô∏è The user object now has an expandable map of properties, so the user JSON is no longer confined to what is defined in the code.

    Example of new User object:
    ```json
    {
      "email" : {
        "address" : "test@test.com",
        "verified" : "true",
        "verificationToken" : "hashToken"
      },
      "password" : "12345",
      "properties" : {
        "stringProperty" : "myUserObject",
        "integerProperty": 1000,
        "listsWorkToo": ["hello", "world"]
      }
    }
    ```
  This applies to **ALL** `/user` methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and **ALL** `/verify` methods: `GET`, `POST`
* ‚ö†Ô∏è All configuration options that used hyphens now are camel-case. For example, `table-name` has become `tableName`
* ‚ö†Ô∏è The `ses` configuration object has been renamed to `email`
* ‚ö†Ô∏è The `dynamo` configuration object has been renamed to `database`
* ‚ö†Ô∏è The package name for the `api`, `application`, and `client` have changed from `com.sanction.thunder` to `com.sanctionco.thunder`

## ‚öõ Fixed
* `POST` `/verify` now correctly checks for a matching user password in the request header before sending the email.

## ‚òï Client
* ‚ö†Ô∏è `PilotUser` renamed to `User` and object definition changed. See the `Features` section above for more information.

## ‚û°Ô∏è DevOps
* New [logo](https://github.com/RohanNagar/thunder/blob/master/scripts/resources/vertical.png)!
* Multiple custom issue templates added for creating new Github issues

# v1.2.0

## Features
* Add support for returning HTML in the response for `/verify`

## Client
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Upgraded Retrofit from v1.9 to v2.4
  * All endpoint URLs passed into `ThunderBuilder` must end in a slash `/`
  * `ThunderClient` now returns a `Call<PilotUser>` instead of `PilotUser`. Example:

     1.1.2 (old):
     ```
     PilotUser user = thunderClient.getUser("USERNAME", "PASSWORD");
     ```

     1.2.0 (new):
     ```
     PilotUser user = thunderClient.getUser("USERNAME", "PASSWORD").execute().body();
     ```
