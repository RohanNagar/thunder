## Endpoints
- `POST` `/users`
  
  The POST endpoint is for adding a new user to the database.
  Must post with a JSON body that defines a PilotUser.
  The body should look similar to the following.

  ```json
  {
    "email" : {
      "address": "sampleuser@sanctionco.com"
    },
    "password" : "12345",
    "facebookAccessToken" : "facebookAccessToken",
    "twitterAccessToken" : "twitterAccessToken",
    "twitterAccessSecret" : "twitterAccessSecret"
  }
  ```
  
- `PUT` `/users`

  The PUT endpoint is for updating a specific user.
  The body of the request must be JSON that defines the PilotUser that is being updated.
  All fields must be present in the JSON, or they will be overridden in the database as `null`.
  Additionally, the email of the user must be the same in order for the PUT to be successful.
  
- `GET` `/users?email=sampleuser@sanctionco.com`
  
  The GET request must set the email query parameter. Additionally, the password of the user must be
  included as a header parameter for security reasons.
  The response will contain the PilotUser JSON object.

- `DELETE` `/users?email=sampleuser@sanctionco.com`

  The DELETE request must set the email query parameter. Additionally, the password of the user must
  be included as a header parameter for security reasons.
  The user will be deleted in the database,
  and the response will contain the PilotUser object that was just deleted.

- `POST` `/verify?email=sampleuser@sanctionco.com`

  A POST request sent to the verify endpoint is used to initiate a user verification process by
  sending a verification email to the email address provided as a query parameter. The password of
  the user must be included as a header parameter. The user in the database will be updated to
  include a unique verification token that is sent along with the email.

- `GET` `/verify?email=sampleuser@sanctionco.com&token=12345&response_type=json`

  A GET request sent to the verify endpoint is used to verify a user email. The endpoint is called
  with an email address and a verification token that has been sent to the user via email.
  Upon verification, the user object in the database will be updated to indicate that the email address
  is verified. The `response_type` query parameter determines if the method should return either an HTML
  success page or a JSON user response. If HTML is specified, the URL will redirect to `/verify/success`.
  The default `response_type` is JSON.

- `GET` `/verify/success`

  This GET request will return an HTML success page that is shown after a user successfully verifies
  their account. `GET /verify` will redirect to this URL if the `response_type` query parameter
  is set to `html`.

## Client Library Usage

Thunder is available through [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#RohanNagar/thunder).
This means you can include the client whether your project is Maven, Gradle, sbt, or Leiningen.
See the [wiki](https://github.com/RohanNagar/thunder/wiki/Using-the-Java-Client) for more detailed information.

Include the latest version of the client module as a dependency. For example, with Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.RohanNagar.thunder</groupId>
  <artifactId>client</artifactId>
  <version>${thunder.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Create a new `ThunderClient` instance with
  1. The endpoint to access Thunder over HTTP.
  2. Your application key.
  3. Your application secret.

> Note: The endpoint **must** end in a slash '/'.

```java
ThunderClient thunderClient = new ThunderBuilder("ENDPOINT", "USER-KEY", "USER_SECRET")
                                .newThunderClient();
```

Any of the methods in `ThunderClient` are now available for use. For example, to get a user:

```java
PilotUser user = thunderClient.getUser("EMAIL", "PASSWORD")
  .execute()
  .body();
```

## Running Locally
Fork this repo on GitHub. Then, clone your forked repo onto your machine
and navigate to the created directory.

```bash
$ git clone YOUR-FORK-URL
$ cd thunder
```

Run the `bootstrap.sh` script to make sure your machine has all the necessary dependencies
and to install code dependencies.

```bash
$ ./scripts/tools/bootstrap.sh
```

> Note: The script will install Java 8, Maven, Node.js, and NPM for you.
>
> For those on Linux, the script will use `apt-get` to install the packages.
>
> For those on macOS, the script will use `brew` to install the packages.

Compile and package the source code with Maven.

```bash
$ mvn package
```

Start up local dependencies (DynamoDB and SES) in the background so that Thunder can perform all functionality.

```bash
$ node scripts/tools/run-local-dependencies.js &
```

Run the packaged jar.

```bash
$ java -jar application/target/application-*.jar server config/local-dev-config.yaml
```

Thunder should now be running on localhost port 8080!

## Testing
There is a Node.js testing script available in the `scripts` directory.
To run this script, make sure you are in the base thunder directory and run the following command.

```bash
$ node scripts/src/test-runner.js
```

For more detailed information on the Node.js scripts, their command line arguments, and how to run them, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/RohanNagar/thunder/wiki/Running-Node.js-Scripts).

The `test-runner.js` script expects Thunder to be running. If you want to run the integration tests without first starting Thunder, use the `integration-tests.sh` script in the `scripts/tools/` directory.

```bash
$ sh -c scripts/tools/integration-tests.sh
```

Alternatively, you can run the commands using [HTTPie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) to test each of the available endpoints.
Simply replace the brackets with the appropriate information and run the command via the command line.

- `http -a {application}:{secret} GET localhost:8080/users?email={email} password:{password}`
- `http -a {application}:{secret} POST localhost:8080/users < {filename}`
- `http -a {application}:{secret} PUT localhost:8080/users < {filename} password:{password}`
- `http -a {application}:{secret} DELETE localhost:8080/users?email={email} password:{password}`

## Modifying for Personal Use
If you would like to create your own user management REST API based on this project, start by forking this repository.

After cloning the fork to your computer, you can take the following steps to make this project conform to your own:

1. Modify the `PilotUser` class.

This is the class that represents a user. Modify the name of the class in order to represent your own user.
For example, if your application is called `Thunder`, considering changing the name of the class to `ThunderUser`.
Then, modify the attributes of the class to include what is neccessary to represent a user in your application.

2. Modify the `UsersDao` class.

If you are using DynamoDB for your implementation, this step may not be necessary other than refactoring based on
the keys you want to use to look up by. For example, if you want to get users based on username instead of email, you
will change the `insert()` method to insert `.withPrimaryKey("username", user.getUsername())`.

If you are using another database type, then you will want to completely rewrite this class. Keep all method names
the same, but modify the implementation to insert/search/delete from your database. Additionally, you will want to modify
the instantiation of this class in the `DaoModule` class to match your new constructor, and you will want to replace the `dynamodb`
package with your own package that includes a Dagger Module and a HealthCheck.

3. Open an issue for any further questions.

If you have questions about modifying this project to fit your own needs, feel free to open an issue on Github and we will
do our best to help you incorporate this project into your backend.

## Running on Kubernetes

The official Thunder Docker image is published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rohannagar/thunder/).

1. Modify the `scripts/kubernetes/thunder-deployment.yaml` file to use the desired image version.
The default image is `rohannagar/thunder:test`. Also set the correct values for your AWS access keys.

```yaml
...
containers:
  - name: thunder
    image: rohannagar/thunder:test # Replace this if desired
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    env:
      - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        value: # Set value here
      - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        value: # Set value here
...
```

2. Modify the `scripts/kubernetes/thunder-config.yaml` file by replacing the `config.yaml` section with
the configuration you desire.

3. Connect to your K8s cluster, running anywhere.

4. Deploy the Thunder ConfigMap to your K8s cluster:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f scripts/kubernetes/thunder-config.yaml
```

5. Deploy the Thunder deployment to your K8s cluster:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f scripts/kubernetes/thunder-deployment.yaml
```

6. Run `kubectl get pods` to see that two instances of Thunder have started up and are running!
