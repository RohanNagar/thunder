#####################

Thunder is a REST API that interfaces with a DynamoDB database to provide an easy way to create, update, fetch, and delete users.
Thunder was originally built as part of the backend for a social media management application, but has since evolved into a generic user management application.
See the roadmap for more information on where Thunder is headed.

This documentation holds information about how to use Thunder in your own applications. See the links on the sidebar to read more.

Keep up-to-date by viewing the changelog.
